# Taylor Hawkins: 1972-2022

This is a cathartic recreation of an app I built for Taylor in 2010 for his then new record *Red Light Fever*. For whatever reason, we were obsessed with 8-Track players at the time and I began recording modern albums to 8-Track. The audio you hear on this player was actually recorded to 8-Track first before being recorded back into a digital file.  If you're looking for high quality Taylor recordings, try Spotify, Apple Music, or your local record store. My thoughts go out to Taylor's family and all those he touched. RIP.
